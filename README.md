Utilizing Kickstarter data to complete an analysis of trends

### Challenge
Conclusions
1.	The majority of Kickstarter campaigns for plays, a total of 720, kept a goal between $0 and $5000. With a smaller goal, we find that there is a higher opportunity for success for those campaigns, averaging a 74% success rate. 
2.	Although all campaigns less than $15,000 are have more success than failure, the percentage of successful campaigns drops from 76% to 50% once a goal exceeds $15,000. After a campaign goal exceeds $35,000, the average success rate drops to 36%.
3.	More theater campaigns are typically launched during the months of May and June, offering a 67% and 65% success rate.
4.	Theater campaigns launched in December and January are more likely to be canceled for fail in comparison to the other months. 

Data Limitations
1.	As Louise narrows her criteria for where she will launch her Kickstarter campaign, we can also filter based on location for the outcomes based on goals and launch date. The data may differ if we look at it from additional criteria like location and the number of backers for the successful versus failed campaigns. 
2.	I recommend creating an additional tab showcasing outcome based on duration. The durations will be grouped to perform a count of successful campaigns that took place during a certain time period. Looking at this from the perspective of plays allows us to identify any trends on how success correlates with not just campaign goal, but also duration. 
3.	Louise may also find it helpful to understand the mean and median for the goals and pledged amounts for the theater campaigns. Having the mean for both successful and failed campaigns can give her an idea of a potential goal for her campaign. 
4.	Outliers should also be identified to understand if any data points are being skewed. A box plot can easily visualize this based on specific criteria set. The box plot will showcase the outliers based on how far above or below they are from the first and third quartiles. The first quartile is the median of the bottom half of the numbers in the data set and the third quartile is the median of the top half of the numbers in the data set.
